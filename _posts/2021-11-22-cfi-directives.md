# .cfi GNU Assembler Directives

In Chapter 10, our first look at the assembly language generated by `gcc` included a lot of assembly directives that start with `.cfi`. I showed you the `gcc` command line options to eliminate these directives from the code so we could focus on the machine instructions. In case you're curious, let's look here at how these directives are used by the `gdb` debugger.

7         unsigned int current = 1; /* assume base case */
8         if (n != 0)
9           current = n * factorial(n - 1);
10        return current;
