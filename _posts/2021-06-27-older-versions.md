I've written two introductory-level books about computer hardware and how it's programmed. One is based on the Intel/AMD x86-64 instruction set, the other on the ARM instruction set used on the Raspberry Pi.

The latest x86-64 version is available at
[No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/).
The original version of
[Introduction to Computer Organization with x86-64 Assembly Language & GNU/Linux](http://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/)
is still online.

The current version of [Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Language Using the Raspberry Pi](http://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/)
is only available online. I have started rewriting it.

I don't charge for the online verstions, but be aware that you may need to pay connection fees on your end.
