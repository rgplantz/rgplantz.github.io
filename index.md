I've written two introductory-level books about computer hardware and how it's programmed. One is based on the ARM instruction set used on the Raspberry Pi, the other on the Intel/AMD x86-64 instruction set. Both books are significant rewrites of the books I originally offered online.

- [Introduction to Computer Organization, ARM version](https://nostarch.com/introcomputerorgforarm), revised and updated edition.

  [Superseded edition](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/intro-co-rpi.html)  is still online.

- [Introduction to Computer Organization, x86-64 version](https://nostarch.com/introcomporg/), revised and updated edition

  [Superseded edition](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-x64/book.html) is still online.

I don't charge for the online versions, but be aware that you may need to pay connection fees on your end.

Here are some resources to help you get the most from reading my books, including:
- Source code for the example programs in the book; I don't include the compiler-generated assembly language because you can generate those files from the provided C/C++ source code files.
- Solutions to most of the **Your Turn** exercises
- A list of corrections to the text; if you discover any errors, please [send me email](<mailto:bob@computer.org> "email at bottom"). I like to give credit to the person who finds the error; please let me know if it's okay to use your name.

- [x86-64 version](./itco_x86-64/)
