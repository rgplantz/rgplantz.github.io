This is the place where you'll find resources for my book, [Introduction to Computer Organization: An Under the Hood Look at Hardware and x86-64 Assembly](https://nostarch.com/introcomporg).

You can download the [**solutions**](./itco_x86-64/) to the exercises in the x86-64 book along with the source code of the programs in the book from GitHub.
