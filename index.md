I provide [resources](./itco_x86-64/) to help you get the most from reading my book, [Introduction to Computer Organization: An Under the Hood Look at Hardware and x86-64 Assembly](https://nostarch.com/introcomporg).
- A list of corrections to the text. If you discover any errors, please [send me email](<mailto:rgplantz@outlook.com> "email at bottom"). I like to give credit to the person who finds the error; please let me know if it's okay to use your name.
- Solutions to most of the **Your Turn** exercises, and the source code for the example programs in the book.
- Source code for the example programs in the book.
I don't include the compiler-generated assembly language because you can generate those files from the provided C/C++ source code files.
