[This is the place](./itco_x86-64/x86-64_errata) where you'll find resources for my book, [Introduction to Computer Organization: An Under the Hood Look at Hardware and x86-64 Assembly](https://nostarch.com/introcomporg).

I provide [solutions](./itco_x86-64/) to most of the **Your Turn** exercises, and the [source code](./itco_x86-64/) for the example programs in the book. I don't include the compiler-generated assembly language because you can generate those files from the provided C/C++ source code files.

As I learn about errors in the book, I maintain an [errata](./itco_x86-64/). If you discover any errors, please [send me email](<mailto:rgplantz@outlook.com> "email at bottom").
