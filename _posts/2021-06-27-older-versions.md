I've written two introductory-level books about computer hardware and how it's programmed. One is based on the ARM instruction set used on the Raspberry Pi, the other on the Intel/AMD x86-64 instruction set. Both books are significant rewrites of the books I originally offered online.

- [Introduction to Computer Organization, ARM version](https://nostarch.com/introcomputerorgforarm).
The previous version is available online at 
[Sonoma State University](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/intro-co-rpi.html).

- [Introduction to Computer Organization, x86-64 version](https://nostarch.com/introcomporg/).
The previous version is available online at 
[Sonoma State University](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-x64/book.html).

I don't charge for the online versions, but be aware that you may need to pay connection fees on your end.
