[This is the place](./itco_x86-64/) where you'll find resources for my book, [Introduction to Computer Organization: An Under the Hood Look at Hardware and x86-64 Assembly](https://nostarch.com/introcomporg).

If you would like an electronic copy of my book, plus 17 other great books, while donating to some great charities for $30, check out this [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/joy-coding-no-starch-press-books). This bundle will be available until 9:00 AM PST March 21, 2020.

You'll find [corrections](./itco_x86-64/) to errors found in the book, [solutions](./itco_x86-64/) to most of the **Your Turn** exercises, and the [source code](./itco_x86-64/) for the example programs in the book. I don't include the compiler-generated assembly language because you can generate those files from the provided C/C++ source code files.
