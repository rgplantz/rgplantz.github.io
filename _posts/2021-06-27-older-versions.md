I've written two introductory-level books about computer hardware and how it's programmed. One is based on the Intel/AMD x86-64 instruction set, the other on the ARM instruction set used on the Raspberry Pi.

I'm doing an extensive rewrite of both books. They'll be available at
[No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/).
We're aiming for September 2021 to publish the x86-64 version, and then we'll start on the ARM version.

Meanwhile, you can read the original versions of
[Introduction to Computer Organization with x86-64 Assembly Language & GNU/Linux](http://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-x64/book.html)
and
[Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Language Using the Raspberry Pi](http://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/intro-co-rpi.html)
online. I don't charge for this, but be aware that you may need to pay connection fees on your end.
If you want to buy your own copy of the original x86-64 version, I have self-published it both in
[paperback](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/robert-g-plantz/introduction-to-computer-organization-paper/paperback/product-1v9429de.html?page=1&pageSize=4)
and in
[PDF](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/robert-plantz/introduction-to-computer-organization-ebook/ebook/product-1g8qp4j7.html?page=1&pageSize=4)
formats.
